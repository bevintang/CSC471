Description
--------------------

The world depicts a scene of courtship between two, inter-species-breeding animal groups -- of duck and of bunny taking place at high noon. What the two species will make together, it is hard to say. But one thing is for sure: there are 20 ducks and only 10 potential baby bunny mommas; a fight for the fittest will surely ensue, leaving only 10 ducks to plant their seed. 

Meanwhile, this ritual is being observed by scientists, and the footage can be viewed from a hyper-flat screen TV conveniently recreated above the group of aroused animals.
