CSC 471 -- Program 2A: Dancing Sun

Student: Bevin Tang
Date: Oct. 6, 2017

** Description: The files animate a dancing sun using OpenGL. The flares of the sun extend and stretch, while an orange-yellowish aura resonates from the central core. Gradiation can be found in all three objects: the core, the flare, and the background. The core gradates from a pale orange to a whiter yellow; the flare gradates from a dark orange to a regular yellow; the background stays one color until outside an 80 pixel radius from the center, from which it gradates from a pale blue to a dark blue. **
